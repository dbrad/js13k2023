Things I'll need to decide and change the engine for:
- Am I making a game that benefits from controller controls, or mouse / touch controls?
    - If controller / keyboard focused I should use the d-pad and buttons code from last year tweaked for 2 threads
    - If mouse / touch, I should go back to a scene-graph / scene-node system to simplify the gui and stuff
- Particle systems are currently commented out, figure out if I need them
- Probably drop down to 1 font, caps only, to save on size.
    - Since I'm targeting 720p I might not need the 5px font this year?
    - Alternatively, if I target the 5px font, I can probably shrink the sprite sheets size
- Need some form of music / ambience
    - Last year I just used timed effects instead of zzfxm

Game Scenes

        Starting Load-out Selection
        Go Button

    Event
    Combat
    Run End

Nodes
    Background(s)
    Map Nodes
    Player Heroes
    Enemies
    Cards

Remove small font?
Add scribe font as 8x8
1 bit graphics?
how do I want to render backgrounds?

should I use more event /subpub based stuff?
    when a card is actioned send out an event to all units that card x was played, and y was the target, if that is me, I should react?

event bus for card effects, all card target sub
    when a card is played, fire an event off of the card id and what nodes were under cursor at the time
    when the target see its own id in the event, update the data accordingly
    should i use this for all input?
    keep a list of under cursor nodes and fire off click events instead of node polling
    this works better due to a lack of nested elements

Ground + Sky Background

TODO LIST
- Start working on card targeting system
- Deck + deck count
- Discard + discard count
- Link cards to their own entities
- Units need hp bar, nameplate, auras
