Things I'll need to decide and change the engine for:
- Am I making a game that benefits from controller controls, or mouse / touch controls?
    - If controller / keyboard focused I should use the d-pad and buttons code from last year tweaked for 2 threads
    - If mouse / touch, I should go back to a scene-graph / scene-node system to simplify the gui and stuff
- Particle systems are currently commented out, figure out if I need them
- Probably drop down to 1 font, caps only, to save on size.
    - Since I'm targeting 720p I might not need the 5px font this year?
    - Alternatively, if I target the 5px font, I can probably shrink the sprite sheets size
- Need some form of music / ambience
    - Last year I just used timed effects instead of zzfxm
